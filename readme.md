# Presentation
NEED A BREAK! is an open source application intended to help you take care of your health while you work on a computer. 
It will encourage you to regularly have a break in order to rest your back and your eyes.

I have made it for my personal usage and personaly use it every day at work and it helps me to not sit for too long. So I decided to share it because maybe it could be useful to someone else.

You will be notified a minute before lockdown :

When it is time to have a break a countdown will appear. The screen will be locked when it reaches 0 :

You can verify that the application is running thanks to the task bar icon :

You can display the application menu by clicking on the coffee cup :

The settings window let you choose how long the application will wait before lockdown :

# Get started
The project is a WPF application targeting .Net Framework 4.5.2. All you need is a copy of Visual Studio Community in order to build it.
Once started, the application creates a coffee cup icon in the task bar to manifest its presence and permits user to interact with it. 
Just click on the coffee cup to open the application menu.
